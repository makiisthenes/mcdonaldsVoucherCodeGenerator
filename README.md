# mcdonaldsVoucherCodeGenerator
From the code on McDonalds UK reciept will autocomplete customer experience survey and output the the voucher code used for discounted food... saves time.

Just a note before,
# This is neither illegal nor unethical because:
# 1 - You need an reciept to get the discount code;
# 2 - We all love the McDonalds, we will always give top marks in quality research.
# It's just another tool made by the force of laziness.


Will take an reciept that looks like this...

Which states the code: C63WTMDRFP93

Using this python script it will output the voucher code on terminal at record speeds!!
Feel free to use this code in anyway you would like to.
