# mcdonaldsVoucherCodeGenerator
 From the code on McDonalds UK reciept will autocomplete customer experience survey and output the the voucher code used for
 discounted food... saves time.
<hr>
 Just a note before, </br>
 This is neither illegal nor unethical because: </br>
 1 - You need an reciept to get the discount code; </br>
 2 - We all love the McDonalds, we will always give top marks in quality research. </br>
 It's just another tool made by the force of laziness. </br>

Will take an reciept that looks like this... </br>

Which states the code: C63WTMDRFP93 </br>

Using this python script it will output the voucher code on terminal at record speeds!! </br>
<i>Feel free to use this code in anyway you would like to.</i> </br>
